# Studio Roguelike Workshop

# Introduction

This project is ACM Studio at UCLA's roguelike workshop series.

## Setup

This project uses Unity 2022.3.34f1.

In addition, line endings are set up to use CRLF. If you plan on pushing, it is recommended to turn on `autocrlf` by running the command `git config core.autocrlf true`.
